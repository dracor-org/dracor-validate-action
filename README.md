This GitHub Action validates XML files against different schemas and presents
the validation output in the action summary. Currently
[TEI-All](https://github.com/TEIC/TEI) and the
[DraCor Schema](https://github.com/dracor-org/dracor-schema) are supported. For
the DraCor Schema both the Relax NG and the Schematron rules are checked.

## Inputs

### `files`

The files to validate. This can be a space separated list of file paths (e.g.
`"tei/hamlet.xml tei/othello.xml"`) or a glob pattern (e.g. `"tei/*.xml"`). This
input is required, but it can be an empty string, allowing for validating only
modified files in pull requests or push events (see example below).

### `schema`

The schema to validate. Supported values are:

- `"tei"`: The TEI-All schema (default)
- `"dracor"`: The [DraCor schema](https://github.com/dracor-org/dracor-schema)

### `version`

The schema version to validate against. The defaults are `"4.9.0"` for TEI-All
and `"1.0.0"` for the DraCor schema.

### `warn-only`

If you want to prevent the action from failing even if there are invalid files
set this to `"yes"`. This can be useful if you want to run the validation for
informational purposes only without possibly blocking pull requests from being
merged. Default `"no"`.

## Examples

### Basic usage

In the following examples all XML files in the `tei` directory are always
validated, no matter on which event the action is run.

```yaml
jobs:
  validate_tei:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Validate TEI documents against TEI-All schema
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Validate against current TEI-All schema
        uses: dracor-org/dracor-validate-action@v2.0.0
        with:
          files: tei/*.xml

      - name: Validate against older TEI-All schema
        uses: dracor-org/dracor-validate-action@v2.0.0
        with:
          files: tei/*.xml
          version: '4.6.0'
          warn-only: 'yes'

      - name: Validate against current DraCor schema
        uses: dracor-org/dracor-validate-action@v2.0.0
        with:
          files: tei/*.xml
          schema: dracor
```

### Advanced usage

The following workflow, again, validates all XML files in the `tei` directory
when it is triggered manually (on `workflow_dispatch`). However, for pull
requests or push events it only runs when any of these XML files has changed.

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'tei/*.xml'
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'tei/*.xml'

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  validate_tei:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Validate TEI files
    steps:
      # We need to checkout with fetch-depth 0 or 2 for push events;
      # see https://github.com/tj-actions/changed-files?tab=readme-ov-file#usage-
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4.2.2
        if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' }}
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4.2.2
        if: ${{ github.event_name != 'push' }}

      # Get changed files for push/PR only
      - name: Get changed files
        id: changed-tei-files
        uses: tj-actions/changed-files@v46.05
        if: github.event_name == 'push' || github.event_name == 'pull_request'
        with:
          files: |
            tei/*.xml

      # Get all TEI files for workflow_dispatch
      - name: Get changed files
        id: all-tei-files
        if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'
        run: echo 'files=tei/*.xml' >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      # Validate
      - name: Validate against current DraCor schema
        uses: dracor-org/dracor-validate-action@v2.0.0
        with:
          files: |
            ${{ steps.changed-tei-files.outputs.all_changed_files }}
            ${{ steps.all-tei-files.outputs.files }}
          schema: dracor
```

## Validating locally

With Docker installed this action can also be run locally to validate one or
more TEI files. You need to mount your local TEI files to the `/tei` directory
in the Docker container and adjust the `files` input accordingly. For the
following examples we assume you are running the Docker commands from the
directory containing a directory `tei`.

```sh
docker pull dracor/validate-action:latest
docker run --rm -it -e INPUT_FILES='/tei/*.xml' -v $PWD/tei:/tei dracor/validate-action
```

This validates each XML file in the `tei` directory against the latest supported
TEI version.

To validate against a different TEI version and/or to validate only specific
files you can pass the version number and a file pattern as input arguments:

```sh
docker run --rm -it \
  -e INPUT_FILES='/tei/lessing-*.xml' \
  -e INPUT_SCHEMA=tei \
  -e INPUT_VERSION='4.6.0' \
  -v $PWD/tei:/tei \
  dracor/dracor-validate-action
```

## Development

After you've cloned the repository to your local machine or codespace, you'll
need to perform some initial setup steps before you can develop your action.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You'll need to have reasonably modern versions of
> [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and
> [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) handy (e.g. Node.js v20+ and
> docker engine v20+).

1. :hammer_and_wrench: Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

1. :building_construction: Package the TypeScript for distribution

   ```bash
   npm run bundle
   ```

1. :white_check_mark: Run the tests

   ```bash
   $ npm test

   ...
   ```

1. :hammer_and_wrench: Build the container

   ```bash
   docker build -t dracor/validate-action .
   ```

1. :white_check_mark: Test the container

   You can pass individual environment variables using the `--env` or `-e` flag.

   ```bash
   $ docker run --env INPUT_SCHEMA=dracor dracor/validate-action
   ...
   ```

   Or you can pass a file with environment variables using `--env-file`.

   ```bash
   $ echo "INPUT_VERSION='4.6.0'" > ./.env.test

   $ docker run --env-file ./.env.test dracor/validate-action
   ...
   ```
